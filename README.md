Web Software System
===================

> A **Web Software System** is a collection of networked components representing different aspects of a presence, organized in patterns and manifest using browser/server technology.

There are many ways in which to organize and evolve a software system. In this organization there are common underpinnings that become evident in many systems. This project presents a system of organization backed by real code that can serve as the starting point for many types of systems.

All parts of a system can be represented by a model and a model can be composed of many smaller models. Models can be governed by general patterns and guided by principles. The discussion below is organized in these terms in order to build a cohesive model of understanding and realization.
